I am a Special Education teacher by training with a serious passion for data. My mission is to build your capacity to get up and running with your data and take the hassle out of trying to figure out what to do with all those numbers you've collected. My secondary mission is to make the prettiest possible data visualization. In my spare time, I like to hike, camp, birdwatch, and take photographs.
