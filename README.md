# Feedback to-do list. 

## Laura
I think this sentence is a little wordy and it was hard to follow at the beginning. "My mission is to build your capacity to get up and running with your data and take the hassle out of trying to figure out what to do with all those numbers you’ve collected." Put the portfolio link at the top instead of the bottom. I like the portfolio but would add horizontal lines to separate the sections

## Arielle
agree with lor’s thought about the mission statement. some thoughts… 
it sounds like basically you’re saying you want to help them take a pile of data and turn it into something useful, and also to empower them to run with what you build. is that accurate?
cool. I think you can get a lot simpler and still get that point across. “My mission is to help you get you up and running with your data-- from determining how to organize and visualize it, to empowering you to run with what we build together.” or something

## Zach 
My feedback would be to consider describing your projects in a more straightforward way that showcases the skills and programs that you used in a keyword-friendly way. At least that's how I would think about it as a resume. 

And if there was a way to include graphics of screenshots of some of the visualizations on the page that would be great. I think that would really showcase the kind of thing that you're doing.
