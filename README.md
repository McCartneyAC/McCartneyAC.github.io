agree with lor’s thought about the mission statement. some thoughts… 
it sounds like basically you’re saying you want to help them take a pile of data and turn it into something useful, and also to empower them to run with what you build. is that accurate?
cool. I think you can get a lot simpler and still get that point across. “My mission is to help you get you up and running with your data-- from determining how to organize and visualize it, to empowering you to run with what we build together.” or something

My feedback would be to consider describing your projects in a more straightforward way that showcases the skills and programs that you used in a keyword-friendly way. At least that's how I would think about it as a resume. 

And if there was a way to include graphics of screenshots of some of the visualizations on the page that would be great. I think that would really showcase the kind of thing that you're doing.
